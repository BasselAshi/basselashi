# 🚧 Welcome to… Something 🚧
**Status:** Work in progress. Always. Forever.

You’ve stumbled upon my GitHub profile.  
It’s kind of like walking into a workshop at 3am — tools everywhere,  
half-built things on every table, and the faint smell of ambition.

## 📜 House Rules
1. Don’t trip over the TODOs.
2. If you find a bug, it was a *feature test*.
3. Commits happen when they happen.

---

## ⏳ Current Phase
Somewhere between:
- “Just one more tweak…”
- “Let’s start over.”

---

## 📊 Random Stats
- Caffeine level: **critical**
- Number of tabs open: **don’t ask**
- Percentage of finished ideas: `NaN`

---

## 🗓 Coming Soon
...probably.
